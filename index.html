                <h2>Djoser (reign 2686 BC – 2649 BC)</h2>
                    <p>Djoser is perhaps the most famous Third Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh, but little is known about his life. What is known, however, is that he oversaw the construction of the famous step pyramid at Saqqara, a hugely significant milestone in ancient Egyptian architecture. This pyramid, in which Djoser was buried, was the first structure to realise the iconic step design.</p>

                <h2>Khufu (reign 2589 ‒ 2566 BC)</h2>
                    <p>A Fourth Dynasty pharaoh, Khufu’s greatest legacy is undoubtedly the Great Pyramid of Giza, one of the Seven Wonders of the World.
                    The monumental structure is a testament to the bewildering sophistication of Egyptian architecture and, remarkably, remained the tallest man-made structure in the world for the best part of 4,000 years. It was conceived by Khufu as his stairway to heaven and the means of its construction remains something of a mystery to this day.</p>

                <h2>Hatshepsut (reign 1478–1458 BC)</h2>
                    <p>Only the second woman to assume the role of pharaoh, Hatshepsut was the wife of Thutmose II and reigned in the Eighteenth Dynasty. Her step-son Thutmose III was just two years old when his father died in 1479 and so Hatshepsut soon took on the role of pharaoh (though Thutmose III also technically ruled as co-regent).</p>

                <h2>Thutmose III (reign 1458–1425 BC)</h2>
                    <p>Thutmose III dedicated himself to military training while his step-mother was pharaoh, only taking over the role of main ruler when Hatshepsut died in 1458.
                    The pharaoh’s military training paid off and he earned a reputation as something of a military genius; indeed, Egyptologists sometimes refer to him as the Napoleon of Egypt. Thutmose III never lost a battle and his military exploits won him the respect of his subjects and, for many, a status as the greatest ever pharaoh.</p>

                <h2>Amenhotep III (reign 1388–1351 BC)</h2>
                    <p>During Amenhotep III’s 38-year reign, he largely presided over a peaceful and prosperous Egypt. Indeed, Amenhotep III’s accomplishments as pharaoh were more cultural and diplomatic than military; few Ancient Egyptian pharaohs can match his architectural and artistic legacy.</p>

                    <p>The son of Amenhotep III, Akhenaten was named Amenhotep IV at birth but changed his name in accordance with his radical monotheistic beliefs. The meaning of his new name, “He who is of service to the Aten”, honoured what he believed to be the one true god: Aten, the Sun God.</p>

                    <p>The youngest pharaoh in Egyptian history when he ascended to the throne at just 9 or 10 years old, Tutankhamun became the most famous Egyptian pharaoh of all.But the young pharaoh’s fame isn’t the result of extraordinary achievements but instead derives almost entirely from the discovery of his tomb in 1922 – one of the great archaeological finds of the 20th century.</p>

                    <p>Ramses II’s reign was undoubtedly the greatest of the 19th Dynasty and, even by pharaoh standards, unabashedly ostentatious. The son of Seti I, with whom he had a period of co-regency, Ramses II went on to declare himself a god, while earning a reputation as a great warrior, fathering 96 children and ruling for 67 years.</p>

                    <p>Xerxes I reigned in the 27th Dynasty during which time Egypt was part of the Persian Empire, having been conquered in 525 BC. Persian Achaemenid Kings were acknowledged as pharaohs and so Xerxes the Great, as he was known, earns a place on our list by virtue of fame, if not popularity.</p>

                <h2>Cleopatra VII (reign 51 – 30 BC)</h2>
                    <p>The last active ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, Cleopatra presided over the dying days of the Egyptian empire, yet her fame has lived on through folklore, Shakespeare and Hollywood. It’s hard to disentangle the real Cleopatra from the legend but scholars suggest that her portrayal as a stunningly beautiful seductress undersells her brilliance as a leader.</p>
